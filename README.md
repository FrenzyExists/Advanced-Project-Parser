Generates an Excel file that can be used to distribute student projects among TAs for grading.

To run the script, you need to create a Github Personal Access Token (PAT) for your account. You can do this by going to your Github settings, selecting "Developer Settings", and then "Personal Access Tokens". Generate a new token with the "repo" scope. Copy the token and paste it into the `GITHUB_TOKEN` variable in a `.env` file. An example can be seen in the example.env file.

Alternatively, you can create one by clicking [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).
